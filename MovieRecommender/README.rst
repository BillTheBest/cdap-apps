MovieRecommender
================

Movie recommendation application

Overview
--------
The MovieRecommender recommends movies to users using collaborative filtering technique.

* The ``ratings`` and ``movies`` data is taken from `MovieLens Dataset <http://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/>`_
* The recommendation engine is based on the ALS (Alternating Least Square) implementation in Apache Spark MLlib library.

Implementation Details
----------------------

There are number of components that compose MovieRecommender CDAP application.

* ``Streams`` for ingesting ``ratings`` data into the system
* ``Flowlet`` in a ``Flow`` which processes this ``ratings`` data and store them in a ``Dataset``
* ``Service`` to store ``movies`` in ``Dataset``
* ``Spark`` Program which builds a recommendation model using ALS algorithm and recommends movies for all the users
* ``Procedure`` to query the application with userId to get recommendations for a particular user

Most interesting part that holds the logic behind building recommendations is RecommendationBuilder Spark program.

Installation & Usage
====================
From the project root, build ``MovieRecommender`` with the `Apache Maven <http://maven.apache.org/>`_ command::

  MAVEN_OPTS="-Xmx512m" mvn clean package
  
Deploy the Application to a CDAP instance defined by its host (defaults to localhost)::

  bin/app-manager.sh --host [host] --action deploy
  
Start Application Flows, Services and Procedures::

  bin/app-manager.sh --host [host] --action start
  
Make sure that Flows, Services and Procedures are running. We will start Spark program later::

  bin/app-manager.sh --host [host] --action status
  
Ingest ``ratings`` and ``movies`` data::

  bin/ingest-data.sh --host [host]

Run the ``RecommendationBuilder`` Spark Program::

  bin/app-manager.sh --host [host] --action run

Spark program will take some time to complete. You can check the status by::

  bin/app-manager.sh --host [host] --action status
  
Query for recommendations

Send a query via an HTTP request using the ``curl`` command. For example::

  curl -v -d '{"userId":"1"}' \ -X POST 'http://localhost:10000/v2/apps/MovieRecommender/procedures/RecommendMovieProcedure/methods/getRecommendation'

On Windows, a copy of ``curl`` is located in the ``libexec`` directory of the example::

  libexec\curl -v -d '{"userId":"1"}' \ -X POST 'http://localhost:10000/v2/apps/MovieRecommender/procedures/RecommendMovieProcedure/methods/getRecommendation'
  
This will return a JSON of rated and recommended movies::

  {"rated":["ratedMovie1","ratedMovie1"],"recommended":["recommendedMovie1","recommendedMovie2"]}

Stop the application::

  bin/app-manager.sh --host [host] --action stop

:Note: ``[--host ]`` is not available for a *Standalone CDAP*.
