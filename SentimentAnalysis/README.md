Twitter Configuration
=====================
In order to utilize the TweetCollector flowlet, which pulls a small sample stream via the Twitter API, the API key and Access token must be configured.
Follow the steps at the following page to obtain these credentials: [Twitter oauth access tokens](https://dev.twitter.com/oauth/overview/application-owner-access-tokens).
Place the authentication configuration in a file named 'twitter4j.properties' in src/resources, according to: [Twitter4j configuration](http://twitter4j.org/en/configuration.html).
Alternatively, these configurations can be provided as runtime arguments to the flow prior to starting it.
